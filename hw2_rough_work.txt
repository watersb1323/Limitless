2. Palindrome
	racecar = 7/2 = 3.5 -- want 4
	anna = 4/2 = 2 -- want 2
verdict: use ceil()
	Better way to do it:
	split each string in to 2 substrings:
	racecar
		- race -- 	
			- Obtained by 7/2 = 3.5 ~= 4-1= 3
			- Extract sub-string [0:3]
		- ecar
			- Same as above and extract substring [3:end]
	Reverse the order of the letters in the second substring and compares
